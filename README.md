lessThan is a method to get rid of objects in an array, which are bigger in length than desired.
lessThan takes in 2 arguments: maxl - maximum length of an objects(all objects' length will be maxl-1 or smaller), and array itself
The methdod makes string newStr, which contains all objects to be left
after going through all objects the method will split newStr and return it as array
